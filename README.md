🔧 Evolution of the Project
The development of this app involved a significant architectural shift. When legacy database constraints threatened scalability, the project underwent a full "rollback and reset." This allowed for the implementation of a more flexible schema and a strictly typed tRPC router, proving that technical excellence often requires the courage to refactor.
